"""
Library for complex valued neural networks in pytorch.
Builds on top of the native complex number support in pytorch.
Builds on top of https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/complexPyTorch, and adds some functionalities.

This is the base-file to import from.
Function- / Layer- Files have more, but redundant features.

If a function is not in here, it is probably implemented in normal pytorch and this can by used.
